# Spam-SMS-Detection
## Description
Spam SMS Detection is a machine learning project that classifies SMS messages as spam or not spam (ham). The project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and various machine learning models to analyze text messages and improve classification accuracy.

## Dataset
Dataset used: Kaggle - SMS Spam Collection

Text: The SMS message content
Label: Spam (1) or Ham (0)

## Data Preprocessing

Text cleaning (lowercasing, stopword removal, punctuation removal)
Tokenization and stemming using NLTK

## Feature Engineering

TF-IDF Vectorization
Count Vectorization

## Machine Learning Models Used

1. Na√Øve Bayes (MultinomialNB)
2. Support Vector Machine (SVC)
3. Decision Tree Classifier
4. Random Forest Classifier

## Evaluation Metrics
